In Kdenlive, we use two such caches, a persistent that is stored on disk to allow thumbnails to be reused when reopening. The other one is a volatile LRU cache that lives in memory. Note that for the volatile cache uses a custom implementation. QCache is not suitable since it operates on pointers and since the object is removed from the cache when accessed. KImageCache is not suitable since it lacks a way to remove objects from the cache. Note that this class is a Singleton. " alt="" coords="5,5,136,32"/>
